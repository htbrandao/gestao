# PMBOK - PMBOK 7th Edition

## 1. Introduction

This standard applies regardless of industry, location, size, or delivery approach, for example, predictive, hybrid, or adaptive. It describes the system within which projects operate, including governance, possible functions, the project environment, and considerations for the relationship between project management and product management.

- Key Terms & Concepts

    - Outcome: An end result or consequence of a process or project. Outcomes can include
    outputs and artifacts, but have a broader intent by focusing on the benefits and value that
    the project was undertaken to deliver.

    - Portfolio: Projects, programs, subsidiary portfolios, and operations managed as a group
    to achieve strategic objectives.

    - Product: An artifact that is produced, is quantifiable, and can be either an end item in itself or a component item.

    - Program: Related projects, subsidiary programs, and program activities that are managed
    in a coordinated manner to obtain benefits not available from managing them individually.

    - Project: A temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result.
    The temporary nature of projects indicates a beginning and an end to the project work or
    a phase of the project work. Projects can stand alone or be part of a program or portfolio.

    - Project management: The application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to
    project activities to meet project requirements. Project management refers to guiding the
    project work to deliver the intended outcomes. Project teams can achieve the outcomes
    using a broad range of approaches (e.g., predictive, hybrid, and adaptive).

    - Project manager: The person assigned by the performing organization to lead the project
    team that is responsible for achieving the project objectives. Project managers perform
    a variety of functions, such as facilitating the project team work to achieve the outcomes
    and managing the processes to deliver intended outcomes.

    - Project team: A set of individuals performing the work of the project to achieve its objectives.

    - System for value delivery: A collection of strategic business activities aimed at building, sustaining, and/or advancing an organization. Portfolios, programs, projects, products, and operations can all be part of an organization’s system for value delivery.

    - Value: The worth, importance, or usefulness of something. Different stakeholders perceive value in different ways. Customers can define value as the ability to use specific features or functions of a product. Organizations can focus on business value as determined with financial metrics, such as the benefits less the cost of achieving those benefits. Societal value can include the contribution to groups of people, communities, or the environment.

- O PMBOK é uma metodologia para gerenciar projetos que têm um início e fim claros, enquanto o ITIL é um conjunto de processos para a gestão contínua de serviços de TI
- PMBOK ajuda a gerenciar "o projeto" (iniciativa temporária), enquanto o ITIL ajuda a gerenciar "o serviço" (entregue de forma contínua)
- ITIL e COBIT são complementares e podem ser usados em conjunto para uma governança de TI mais robusta
- O COBIT define o "porquê" e o "o quê" (estratégia e controle), enquanto o ITIL se aprofunda no "como" (processos operacionais para entregar serviços)
